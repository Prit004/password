Objective

To understand what makes a password strong by testing different passwords using online password strength checkers and analyzing how complexity impacts security.

Tools Used

Password Strength Checker: https://passwordmeter.com/

Text Editor: Notepad 

Platform: Windows

Procedure:

Created multiple passwords with varying complexity levels.

Tested each password using PasswordMeter.com.

Recorded the strength score, feedback, and suggestions.

Analyzed results to determine key factors that make passwords strong.

Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary, phishing, etc.).

Summarized how password complexity affects overall security.



Tested Passwords and Results
Password	       Description	                       Score (%)	        Feedback (Summary)

pritam	                 Simple lowercase                    	8%	        Too short, common word, no numbers or symbols.
Pritam	                 Mixed case                             22%	        Good , but easily accessable.
Pritam0                  Mixed case + numbers                   40%             Better but lacks special symbol.
Pritamdutta0	         Mixed case + numbers + symbol	        66%	        Stronger; longer and diverse characters.
Pritamdutta0@	         Long + mixed +  symbol	                85%	        Very strong; hard to guess or brute force.
P@r0it&am!!du0tta1	 Random + complex	                100%	        Excellent entropy; extremely resistant to attacks.

Observations

Passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols received higher scores.

Longer passwords significantly increased strength.

Avoiding dictionary words reduced vulnerability to attacks.

Random characters improved unpredictability and overall security.

Common Password Attacks (Summary)

Brute Force Attack – Tries all possible combinations until the password is found.
 Defense: Use long, complex passwords and enable account lockout or 2FA.

Dictionary Attack – Uses common words or leaked passwords to guess the right one.
 Defense: Avoid real words and predictable patterns.

Phishing Attack – Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake emails or sites.
 Defense: Verify links, use MFA, and stay cautious online.

Credential Stuffing – Reuses stolen credentials on multiple sites.
 Defense: Use unique passwords and a password manager.

Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use at least 12–16 characters.

Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

Avoid personal details like name or birth date.

Never reuse passwords across accounts.

Use passphrases (e.g., C@tJumpsOver#Fence2025).

Store passwords securely using a password manager.

Key Takeaways

Password length and complexity greatly enhance strength.

Uniqueness prevents chain compromises through credential stuffing.

Randomness increases entropy and unpredictability.

2FA and awareness are essential defenses against phishing or social attacks.

Maintaining good password hygiene is crucial for long-term cybersecurity.

Conclusion

Password security depends on length, complexity, uniqueness, and user awareness. Testing results showed that strong, diverse passwords are far more resistant to attacks. By combining strong password creation habits with two-factor authentication and careful online behavior, users can effectively protect their digital identities from common cyber threats.
